"Fake News" using MVVM architecture with Dependency Injection

*The content of the article list refreshed on the following occasions:* 
* starting the app
* resuming from a background state
* resuming to the main screen containing the list of articles

*Some of the techniques:*
* **RecyclerView & glide** - For smoother scrolling while the images loading
* **Dependency Injection**
* **MVVM**

*All you have to do is:*
* Download the APK from the root of the project
* Install the APK (it's not signed so you'll need to allow "Installation from unknown sources" on the device's settings
* Grab a cup of coffee and enjoy :smiley:

## 3rd party libraries
* **Retrofit** - Makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice
* **Glide** - An image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth scrolling
* **Dagger** - Fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework
